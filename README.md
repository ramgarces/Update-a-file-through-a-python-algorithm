<h1>Update a File Through a Python Algorithm</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I will work with a text file that contains IP addresses that are allowed to access speicific restricted content at an organization. The file that will be created will have IP addresses added, removed, and parsed for readability. I will develop an algorithm that parses the text file of IP addresses and updates the file by removing addresses that no longer have access to the restricted content.

<h2>Programming Language(s) Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>
